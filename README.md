# DeepFaintEdges

Demo of detection of faint edges in noisy images. A python notebook that runs the edge detection CNN on a real image as descrived in the ICPR2020 paper: "Multi-scale Processing of Noisy Images using Edge Preservation Losses" http://https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9413325. The supplied h5 checkpoint is a result of training a U-net to detect edges at low SNR given a clean binary image dataset.

Good luck!
