# DeepFaintEdges

Demo of detection of faint edges in noisy images. A python notebook that runs the edge detection CNN on a real image as descrived in the ICPR2020 paper: "Multi-scale Processing of Noisy Images using Edge Preservation Losses". The checkpoint is a result of training a u-net to detect edges at low SNR.
